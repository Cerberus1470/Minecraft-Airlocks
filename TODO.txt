Airlock Ideas
-	Console
    o	Integrates with the canvas and operates things also connected to the canvas.
    o	Should update other consoles also connected to the canvas
-	Canvas Block
    o	The main frame of the airlock, connecting everything up and making an enclosed space.
    o	Almost acts as redstone, connecting the airlock components up.
-	Automatic Door sizing
    o	Similar to paintings, but only detecting 1x2 and 2x2.
    o	Upgrade later?
    o	Start with 1x2.
-	Walkway
    o	Completely different block
    o	Emits light out of certain directions?
    o	Emits smoke particles
-	Corner Canvas Block:
    o	Completely separate Corner Canvas block (easy)
    o	Detection using Canvas block placing (hard)
